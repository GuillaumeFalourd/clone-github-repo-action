Github Action to clone a **public** or **private** Github repository and access its content on others repositories' workflows.

## What changed with the action `v2` ?

This action `v2` is using a **composite action** to be compatible with all operating systems (the `v1` was using a **Dockerfile** that was only compatible with `ubuntu-*` runners).

## How to use this action?

Create a new `.yml` file on your `.github/workflows` directory.

Field | Mandatory | Observation
------------ | ------------  | -------------
**owner** | YES | Ex: `octocat`
**repository** | YES | Ex: `clone-github-repo-action`
**access-token** | NO | [How to create a PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)
**branch** | NO | Ex: `main`

You can use one of those as reference:

- [Clone Public Repo Workflow](https://github.com/GuillaumeFalourd/clone-github-repo-action/blob/main/.github/workflows/public-repo.yml)
- [Clone Private Repo Workflow](https://github.com/GuillaumeFalourd/clone-github-repo-action/blob/main/.github/workflows/private-repo.yml)

### For a public repository

```bash
- name: Clone GuillaumeFalourd/poc-github-actions PUBLIC repository
  uses: GuillaumeFalourd/clone-github-repo-action@v2
  with:
    owner: 'GuillaumeFalourd'
    repository: 'poc-github-actions'
```

### For a private repository

To use this action to clone a `PRIVATE` repository the Github User/Admin has access to, it's necessary to create a [PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `REPOSITORY` scopes.

```bash
- name: Clone GuillaumeFalourd/formulas-training PRIVATE repository
  uses: GuillaumeFalourd/clone-github-repo-action@v2
  with:
    owner: 'GuillaumeFalourd'
    repository: 'formulas-training'
    access-token: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```

### Access repository content

After using this action in your workflow, you can use the following command to access the cloned repository content:

```bash
cd <repository-name>
```

#### Step Example

```bash
- name: Access cloned repository content
  run: |
    cd <repository-name>
    ls -la
```
